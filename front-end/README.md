## Let's Walk through the process.
# Meehso Clone - FrontEnd.

This project is Clone of - [meesho.com](https://meesho.com/) a web application.
Meesho is an online Shopping & Reselling site in India.
Buy & Sell best quality Fashion, Electronics, Home & Kitchen products at lowest prices.

### A Deep Dive First.
This Project is done by me All Alone(Not Alone at all smilface 😁 ).
I ask a lot of different questions to understand the problem.
So the question is from where.
* I ask from mentors.
* I ask from my friends.
* I try to find on google , stackoverflow , etc.

### What you Expect from this project.
* ReactJS
* Redux
* Context API
* Material UI
* Styled Components
* Repetive Code
* PropTypes
* React Router
* MongoDB Realtime Database

I wanna add one more thing that i can avoid many stuffs like repetion of code by making one reusable component for production searching, by not using props and not using the search bar using context API.
All of this thing done by using redux, but why i did not use redux? because i want to use props and context API to make this project full of every concept of react and redux.
Also i use Redux for cart page and and single product page, with this i can state that i use Redux for this project.

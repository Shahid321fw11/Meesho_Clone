### Some More Information not relevant but let me inform 😂. 
This Project is done by me All Alone(Not Alone at all 😁).
I ask a lot of different questions to understand the problem.
So the question is from where.
* I ask from mentors.
* I ask from my friends.
* I try to find on google , stackoverflow , etc.

### What you Expect from this project.
* ReactJS
* Redux
* Context API
* Material UI
* Styled Components
* Repetive Code
* PropTypes
* React Router
* MongoDB Realtime Database

I can avoid many stuffs like repetion of code by making one reusable component for product searching, by not using props and not using the context API for navbar Searching Functionality.
All of these stuffs i could do with using redux, but wait! why i did not use redux for the same? because i want to use props and context API to make this project full of every concept of react and redux.
That don't mean that i did not use redux, I use redux for the same.for cart page and and single product page, with this i can state that i use Redux for this project.

## Thankyou to bear my code 🙌🙌🙌 😊.
